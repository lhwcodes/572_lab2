        <center>I was inspired to make this map by my love for White-Tailed Deer and fascination with wolves.
            Many years ago, I was deer hunting in northern Wisconsin and had a pack of about 6 Grey Wolves pass by me at 80 yards. 
            I had no idea what to think, as my family had never seen wolves up there before. When creating this story, 
            I wanted to see if there was a connection between wolves and the spread of CWD, a deer specific disease that 
            I have done lots of other research into. </center>
